The objective is to ingest a dataset contains user reviews scrapped from Amazon.com and to support some basic queries.

DataStax Astra DB: 
a serverless, multi-cloud database service built on Apache Cassandra that is optimized for real-time applications that require large data volume, low latency, and flexible data models.

Reviews Dataset:
The dataset consist of a set of office products available for purchase at Amazon.com and their
matching reviews given by amazon’s users.
To stay with the limits of the free AstraDB version, you are given a subset of the original
dataset.
The files are easily parsed with JSON. It is recommended to view some examples from each
file before you start programming.
Some of the attributes are missing from the data. In such cases, please enter the
“NOT_AVAILABLE_VALUE” const found in the source code. Do NOT enter “null”s.
